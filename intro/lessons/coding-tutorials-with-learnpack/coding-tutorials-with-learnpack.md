<!--endhide-->

At 4Geeks.com, you will see the word "LearnPack" here and there. You will use LearnPack A LOT to practice coding tutorials and small exercises. This article explains what it is and how to use it so you can run all the tutorials smoothly.

## What is LearnPack?

LearnPack is a tool designed by 4Geeks to teach and learn coding-related skills with interactive, as well as auto-graded and AI-enabled tutorials and exercises. It acts as a package manager for educational content, similar to platforms like npm, brew, etc. but exclusively for technical educational packages.

### What makes LearnPack so unique?

Instead of watching a video or reading an article, LearnPack presents small challenges incrementally; each one is auto-graded for instant feedback and a video tutorial solution (sometimes).

> This is the best way to learn coding-related skills.
