# Coding tutorials with LearnPack
<!--endhide-->

At 4Geeks.com, you will see the word "LearnPack" here and there. You will use LearnPack A LOT to practice coding tutorials and small exercises. This article explains what it is and how to use it so you can run all the tutorials smoothly.

## What is LearnPack?

LearnPack is a tool designed by 4Geeks to teach and learn coding-related skills with interactive, as well as auto-graded and AI-enabled tutorials and exercises. It acts as a package manager for educational content, similar to platforms like npm, brew, etc. but exclusively for technical educational packages.

### What makes LearnPack so unique?

Instead of watching a video or reading an article, LearnPack presents small challenges incrementally; each one is auto-graded for instant feedback and a video tutorial solution (sometimes).

> This is the best way to learn coding-related skills.

## How to use LearnPack?

LearnPack can work in two main ways:

### Option 1: In your browser (recommended for beginners)

This is the **simplest way** to use LearnPack. You don't need to install anything!

**How to start:**

- Click the button that says **"Start interactive exercise"** (or **"Continue interactive exercise"** if you started before)
- The exercise will open directly in your browser
- Start learning and practicing right away!

This option is perfect when you're just beginning. Everything works automatically, and you can focus 100% on learning.

### Option 2: In a code editor (IDE)

Some exercises require working in a code editor (also called IDE). This gives you a more complete workspace. You have two ways to do this:

#### A) In the cloud (Codespace) - Recommended

**How to start:**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learnpack/programming-fundamentals-with-javascript/refs/heads/main/intro/lessons/coding-tutorials-with-learnpack/assets/images/learnpack-exercise-locally.png)
- Click the button that says **"Open locally on your computer"**
- Click the button that says **"Open on the cloud"**
- Choose if you want to start from the beginning or continue from where you left off
- Click the button that says **"Create codespace"**
- Wait a few seconds while everything sets up automatically
- Everything you need will be ready to use!

**Why choose this option?** Everything is configured automatically and you don't need to install anything on your computer.

#### B) On your own computer - Advanced

**How to start:**
- Click the button that says **"Open locally on your computer"**
- Click the button that says **"Open locally on your computer"** again
- Follow the step-by-step instructions with videos
- Install the programs you need
- Once everything is set up, you can work offline

**Why choose this option?** You can work without internet and have full control, but it requires initial setup.

#### Restarting LearnPack (for both A and B)

If you cannot find the instructions on the right side of your screen, you can start the exercises again by typing this in the terminal:
```
learnpack start
```

**Not sure which option to choose?** Don't worry! Your instructor or the course itself will guide you on which environment to use. Most beginners start with Option 1 (in your browser) since it requires zero setup.
