LearnPack is a tool designed by 4Geeks to teach and learn coding-related skills with interactive, as well as auto-graded and AI-enabled tutorials and exercises. It acts as a package manager for educational content, similar to platforms like npm, brew, etc. but exclusively for technical educational packages.

Instead of watching a video or reading an article, LearnPack presents small challenges incrementally; each one is auto-graded for instant feedback and a video tutorial solution (sometimes).
